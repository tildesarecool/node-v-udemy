Nodejs via a Udemy Course
Learning nodejs via a udemy course, also other node related apps

I am following the course at 
https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/learn/v4/content

No idea if I'll go straight through like the JS course but so far it actually seems pretty interesting.
