#Nodejs via a Udemy Course


Learning nodejs via a udemy course, also other node related apps

I am following the course at 
https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/learn/v4/content

No idea if I'll go straight through like the JS course but so far it actually seems pretty interesting.

I had to take a break from the node course and I guess it's good 
I did because the instructor has released v3 of the course which has 
reset my progress. Not that big a deal as I hadn't made it that far. 
Maybe the information will be more current.
