nodemon app.js 
initial setup - install appjs - this downloads dependencies like nodash 
yargs is supposed to be good for parsing CLI arguments
the "--save" make a prereq in the json file so installing notes app.js file
with auto install yargs (alongside nodash)
npm install yargs --save 
udemy video says to specify v4.7.1 of yargs but that is from 2016 so I'm going to risk it and let the latest version install
