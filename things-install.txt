nodemon app.js 
initial setup - install appjs - this downloads dependencies like nodash 
yargs is supposed to be good for parsing CLI arguments
the "--save" make a prereq in the json file so installing notes app.js file
with auto install yargs (alongside nodash)
npm install yargs --save 
udemy video says to specify v4.7.1 of yargs but that is from 2016 so I'm going to risk it and let the latest version install 

this is from 3.15...

first the object:
var JSobject = {
    title: 'This is a test note',
    body: 'with some test content'
};

JSON.stringify: converts object into string, e.g. 
var somevariable = json.stringify(JSobject);

then can write that string to a JSON file:
fs.writefilesync('filename.json', somevariable);

then read that string back fromt he json text file:
var noteSring = fs.readFileSync('notes.json');

and finally convert back to object:
var note = JSON.parse(somevariable);
verify is object or string with
typeof somevariable
